# Project Description
An Artificial Intelligence agent which solves the eight puzzle problem using the A* algorithm. The project aims to evaluate the performance of the following two heuristics:<br>
1. Misplaced Tiles
2. Manhattan Distance

The output displays the turns going into solving the puzzle; it also displays the cost + nodes explored by the A.I agent. <br>

The program was then put throught several puzzles and their outputs were recorded.

# Files
1. 8_puzzle_REBORN: the code itself
2. Heuristic Comparison: a report comparing the two heuristics. The result is in the form of 'cost - nodes explored'.
